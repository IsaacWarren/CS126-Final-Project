    My final project proposal is a pong game that can operate in several modes. The first mode is typical two player pong where both paddles are controlled by human players. The second mode is a training mode. In this mode AI's compete against each other and the winner of each match of pong gets to create offspring that go into the next generation of training. The final mode is one human player playing against a trained AI. I also want to save and load AI's so you don't have to retrain everytime.

    The pong game section shouldn't take too long. I've developed basic games in a python library called pygame before. The graphics functions seem fairly similar so I think I have a decent idea what I'm doing in this regard.

    The neural network stuff is where I plan on spending most of my time. I have a minimal nerual network library called FANN installed and compiling with openframeworks.

    In terms of timeline I want to get pong done the first week, neural network stuff the second and bugfixes/glueing it all togethor the third.

    Possible extensions:
    clients and servers for remote playing
