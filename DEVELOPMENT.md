I had a bit of trouble picking what neural network to use. Unsurprisingly most are for python not c++. I orignially tried pytorch as it had a c++ binding and I knew it was popular. However, its supported build system was cmake while OF uses make. I couldn't figure out how to get the two to work togethor so I looked for a new library. I found FANN which is considerably simpler and I got it to compile with OF relatively easily and got an example app running.
