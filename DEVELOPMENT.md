    I had a bit of trouble picking what neural network to use. Unsurprisingly most are for python not c++. I orignially tried pytorch as it had a c++ binding and I knew it was popular. However, its supported build system was cmake while OF uses make. I couldn't figure out how to get the two to work togethor so I looked for a new library. I found FANN which is considerably simpler and I got it to compile with OF relatively easily and got an example app running.

    Pong is now almost done, the only thing left to do is find a way to diplay the scores larger and there is still some weirdness with bouncing the ball off of the paddles. The hardest part was hit detection and calculating the angles for bouncing the ball off the paddles. Graphics and IO were both surprisingly simple. Everything else wasn't too bad jsut a lot of boilerplate.
